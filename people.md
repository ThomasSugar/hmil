Dr. Thomas Sugar works in the areas of wearable robotics for rehabilitation and gait assistance. In industry, he worked as a project engineer for W. L. Gore and Associates earning a Professional Engineering License. He has been a faculty member in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and The Polytechnic School at Arizona State University. He majored in business and mechanical engineering for his Bachelorâ€™s degrees and mechanical engineering for his Master and Doctoral degree all from the University of Pennsylvania.

Dr. Sugar leads a research effort in wearable robotic systems. He is developing robotic orthoses and prostheses for rehabilitation and enhanced mobility. His current research projects include SPARKy, Spring Ankle with Regenerative Kinetics, a powered prosthetic ankle, PAFO, a powered ankle foot orthosis, and wearable exoskeletons for enhanced gait performance.

Dr. Sugar also has co-founded SpringActive, Inc and the Wearable Robotics Association. The Wearable Robotics Association will host a wearable robotics conference, WearRAcon, in Phoenix on an annual basis.
