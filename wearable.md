### Cooling Suit - Dr. Sangram Redkar was the PI
The suit reduces the body temperature by circulating cool water.

### WalkBe - Walk Beyond

The WalkBe is a wearable device that pushes forward and upward at the waist.  The gentle push makes it easier to walk.  You can lean backwards into the device to rest.

The external force is applied at the waist so that the device does not interfere with the legs during human motion.  The applied force will reduce metabolic cost, make it easier to walk, and make it easier to push or pull objects.

### Sit to Stand
Adjustable leaf springs were used to assist when moving from a sitting position to a standing position

### Spring Loaded Knee
A Jack Spring actuator was mounted across the knee. The stiffness could be adjusted quickly from soft to very stiff.
