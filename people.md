Dr. Thomas Sugar works in the areas of wearable robotics for rehabilitation and gait assistance. In industry, he worked as a project engineer for W. L. Gore and Associates earning a Professional Engineering License. He has been a faculty member in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and The Polytechnic School at Arizona State University. He majored in business and mechanical engineering for his Bachelor’s degrees and mechanical engineering for his Master and Doctoral degree all from the University of Pennsylvania.

Dr. Sugar leads a research effort in wearable robotic systems. He is developing robotic orthoses and prostheses for rehabilitation and enhanced mobility. His current research projects include SPARKy, Spring Ankle with Regenerative Kinetics, a powered prosthetic ankle, PAFO, a powered ankle foot orthosis, and wearable exoskeletons for enhanced gait performance.

Dr. Sugar also has co-founded SpringActive, Inc and the Wearable Robotics Association. The Wearable Robotics Association will host a wearable robotics conference, WearRAcon, in Phoenix on an annual basis.
