## ECS - Equilibrium Controlled Stiffness

Control the input side of the spring to adjust the virtual stiffness and pre-load force

We designed a robotic tendon actuator for powered prostheses and orthoses

[Equations](ecs slide.png)

## SCS - Structure Controlled Stiffness

Adjust the structure of springs to change the stifness properties

### Jack Spring Technology

### Leaf Spring Technology
